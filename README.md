# Auto-Flow-Designer

When turned on the extension will always load the old Power Automate Flow designer.

The new designer has some great features, but it's just not ready yet!!

Save yourself the hassle of always having to toggle back to the old designer manually. 

The extension can be turned off using the extension icon if you do need to use the new designer. 

Installation:
1. Clone the repo or click Code then Download Zip and extract
2. Go to edge://extensions/ or chrome://extensions/ depending on your browser
3. Enable Developer Mode
4. Click Load Unpacked and select the folder containing the extracted files
