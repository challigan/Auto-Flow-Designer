# Auto-Flow-Designer

When turned on the extension will always load the old Power Automate Flow designer.

The new designer has some great features, but it's just not ready yet!!

Save yourself the hassle of always having to toggle back to the old designer manually. 

The extension can be turned off using the extension icon if you do need to use the new designer.
